    <td>Cassie was born January, 7th 1985 in Omaha, Nebraska.  She grew up around horse racing as her parents trained horses.  Her family moved to Grand Island for a number of years where she went to school, but eventually they moved back east where she graduated in Bennington, just outside Omaha.  Cassie married in the summer of 2010 and eventually moved down to Arizona in 2017, leaving the humidity, lawn mowing, and snow shoveling behind!</td>

        <li><h3>Volleyball</h3></li>
          <ol>

            <li>Cassandra always enjoyed playing sports, but starting at the age of ten she found her passion…volleyball.  No one in her family had played volleyball before, but she became infatuated with it after her neighbors installed a sand volleyball court in their backyard.  Watching them play motivated her to practice every day.  Soon she was playing on different local teams, and eventually in high school she played on the Varsity team her sophomore thru senior years.  After graduating, she wanted to still continue playing so she joined different indoor and sand volleyball leagues with friends and her now husband.  She and her husband still enjoy playing sand volleyball whenever they can, and also enjoy just bumping around the volleyball in their yard.

        <li><h3>Final Fantasy Trading Card Game</h3></li>
          <ol>

            <li>When first moving to Arizona, Cassandra and her husband didn’t know very many people.  They both enjoyed video games, one of their favorites being the series Final Fantasy.  After moving, they learned that Final Fantasy had a trading card game.  While searching for a store that sold the cards, she and her husband stumbled upon a store where a few people were playing the game while they were there.  They offered to teach them both how to play, and they’ve both been hooked ever since.  Cassandra has since become one of the event organizers for the area, scheduling the local Final Fantasy Trading Card Game circuit events as well as other large stand-alone events.  She has also helped her local community gain visibility and they have won giveaways and gained recognition throughout North America.  She continues to play the game casually but primarily focuses on event planning, budgeting, and growing the community.

        <li><h3>Music</h3></li>
          <ol>

            <li>Music has always been a large part of Cassandra’s life.  When she was younger, her parents worked where quite a few music concerts took place and they were always able to attend for free.  After catching her first guitar pick, she started to focus on music memorabilia.  The musical history behind different items is what she found particularly intriguing.  Visiting places like Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas were like visiting Disney Land for her.  She has since began collecting music memorabilia of her own that she has gotten at concerts she has attended, as well as from giveaways at different radio stations.  She now has an impressive collection of rock memorabilia that includes a large number of signed posters and cd’s as well as four different signed guitars.  One that she is particularly proud of is a guitar signed by Linkin Park that she got in 2008!

        <li><h3>Learning Japanese</h3></li>
          <ol>

            <li>When other young kids were infatuated with prehistoric times and dinosaurs, Cassandra had her buried in books about Japanese history and culture.  An interest that carried into adulthood, and is also part of the reason a friend introduced her to the man that would become her husband.  The two shared a love for Japanese culture.  After visiting Japan for their honeymoon, the two began to focus on learning the Japanese language.  They took a basic Japanese class at their local community college and began practicing at home.  It’s been a long and slow process, but it’s a process that she has enjoyed thoroughly.  She is now able to speak and read enough of the language to navigate her way around Japan.  She continues to study and hopes that within the next few years she will be able to speak and read the language more fluently.

          <li>Recently, Cassandra started working for PayPal as a Venmo Support Specialist. In this role she assists Venmo customer's via the phone and email with a variety of issues involving their account. She came to PayPal because there were more growth opportunities than at her previous employer.

        <li><h3>City of Chandler, Meter Services</h3></li>
        <ol>

          <li>Before coming to PayPal, she worked for the City of Chander for a little over a year and a half. She started in their Utility Customer Service department taking phone calls from customers. After some networking and discussions with her Supervisor, she decided to take a job in the Utility Meter Services department. This department was going to have supervisor and likely team lead positions available over the next year, which was the areas Cassandra was trying to work back in to. In this position she performed equipment testing, water meter reading, and also performed maintenance on water meters. When she learned that the positions she had hoped for were not going to be available, she decided to apply elsewhere leading to her being hired by PayPal.

        <li><h3>Metropolitan Utility District, Supervisor - Remittance Processing and Billing Projects</h3></li>
        <ol>

          <li>Before moving to Arizona, Cassandra worked for the Metropolitan Utilities District in Nebraska for over 11 years. She originally started as a customer service representative, but quickly moved over to the meter reading department after a few months. In the meter reading department she performed a variety of duties besides just reading meters. She also assisted with dispatching, refined their stat collection, performed equipment testing, trained new employees, and was in charge of their scheduling. M.U.D. later started to migrate to a new system called SAP. Cassandra performed all the testing, created all the training materials, and implemented training for the meter reading department. She also assisted with the testing, training materials, and training for other departments such as customer service and collections. Her hard work on this project caught the eye of one of the Vice Presidents, and she was offered a Collections Specialist Supervisor position. In that position she completely revamped the company's collection processes and helped renegotiate terms with their 3rd party collection agencies. She remained in this position for a year and half, and it's estimated she saved her company approximately $500,000 in that time frame. Soon, she was offered yet another position. She was asked to become the Supervisor of Remittance Processing and Billing Projets. In this role she would manage the employees of the remittance processing department while also managing different projects and still playin a key role in the collections process. She remained in this role for the last 17 months that she and her husband were in Nebraska. During that time she helped her company become PCI compliant, she further refined the collections process, and negotiate additional contracts with 3rd party vendors. She was also part of the process improvement team that used Lean Six Sigma to improve employee and system processes in a variety of departments across the company.
